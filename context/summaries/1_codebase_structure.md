# Codebase Structure Summary

## Overview
This project implements the Volkov Method for solving Laplace equations on polygonal domains, based on E.A. Volkov's book "Block Method for Solving the Laplace Equation and for Constructing Conformal Mappings (1994)".

**REFACTORING STATUS**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - The monolithic volkov.py (980 lines) has been successfully refactored into a modular architecture with ~484 lines in the main solver and mathematical algorithms separated into dedicated modules.

**HOLE SUPPORT STATUS**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** - The solver now fully supports polygonal domains with holes, including proper block generation, boundary condition handling, and visualization for multiply-connected domains.

## Important: Virtual Environment
**Always use the virtual environment when running code:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the venv first
python examples/script.py  # Then run scripts
```
