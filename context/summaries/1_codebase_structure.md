# Codebase Structure Summary

## Overview
This project implements the Volkov Method for solving Laplace equations on polygonal domains, based on E.A. Volkov's book "Block Method for Solving the Laplace Equation and for Constructing Conformal Mappings (1994)".

**REFACTORING STATUS**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - The monolithic volkov.py (980 lines) has been successfully refactored into a modular architecture with ~484 lines in the main solver and mathematical algorithms separated into dedicated modules.

## Important: Virtual Environment
**Always use the virtual environment when running code:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the venv first
python examples/script.py  # Then run scripts
```

## Refactoring Achievements

### ðŸ“Š Metrics
- **Original**: volkov.py = 980 lines (monolithic)
- **Refactored**: volkov.py = 484 lines (~50% reduction)
- **New Modules**: 7 new files for mathematical algorithms
- **Total Lines**: ~2400 lines well-organized across 17 files

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Mathematical algorithms now in dedicated `mathematical/` module
2. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single, clear responsibility
3. **Testability**: Individual mathematical functions can be tested in isolation
4. **Extensibility**: New block types or algorithms can be added easily
5. **Readability**: Main solver now acts as a clear orchestrator

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between mathematical algorithms, core data structures, and solver orchestration
2. **Abstract Base Classes**: PDESolver provides interface for future solver implementations
3. **Factory Pattern**: SolutionState.from_polygon_and_blocks() for complex object initialization
4. **Strategy Pattern**: Different algorithms for each block type in block_covering.py
5. **Vectorized Operations**: Heavy use of NumPy for efficient numerical computation
6. **Masked Arrays**: Efficient handling of irregular domains within rectangular grids
7. **Specialized Visualization**: Separate plotting modules for different visualization needs

## Dependencies
- **NumPy**: Core numerical operations and array handling
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization and plotting
- **pytest**: Testing framework (dev dependency)
