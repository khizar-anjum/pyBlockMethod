- The problem is that you have the habit of adding so many extra and unnecessary routines when you could have just modified existing routines to adapt to new features! I do not like this kind of coding, your implementation should be clean, succinct, and each new routine or line of code should be justified and not just there for the sake of passing this one test! Memorize this!
